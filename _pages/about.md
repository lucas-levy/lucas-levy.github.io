I am a graduate engineering student at [Ecole polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) *(X 2022)*, currently specializing in Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning through the [Mathematics, Vision, Learning (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/) Master's program at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).

Previously, I was a visiting research student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, where I worked on online learning and optimization under the supervision of [Arya Akhavan](https://aryaakhavan.github.io/) and [Patrick Rebeschini](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rebeschi/).

I am currently seeking an internship for April 2026 leading to a PhD position. My research interests lie in Optimization and Learning Theory.
